# FITSviewers
This is an IDL program which can be directly run as a script. The script will query the user to provide a directory or list of files within a directory. The first of these files will then be displayed to the user, who can loop through them using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The program is simple, but extremely useful for quickly examining a large number of FITS images.

Use `fitsDirectoryViewer.pro` to view *all* the FITS files in a directory.

Use `fitsMultipleFileViewer.pro` to view a selection of files within a directory.
